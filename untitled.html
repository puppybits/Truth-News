<h1 data-label="237600" class="ltx_title_section">The Problem</h1><div>With Lyrebird and new AI video reconstruction fake news is about to explode. The will be zero chance of validating the truthfulness of ANY content. The only way to combat these lies will be with the integrity of professionals journalist and the immutability of the facts. If we don't do this now the coming wave of outright lies will be impossible to stop.</div><div>This macro problem can only be fixed by going micro. We can use the blockchain to record facts, audit the truth and make sure it is unchangeable.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="675867" class="ltx_title_subsection">Building and maintaining the system</h2><div></div><div>This should be a company to create the blockchain software</div><div>and associated scripts and apps. Everything will be free.</div><div>Readers can opt-in to cryptocurrency payments with the bulk</div><div>going content creators, auditors and a tiny fraction to</div><div>the company that maintains the system. All companies can</div><div>freely use and embed the scripts into their app/website</div><div>at no cost.</div><div></div><div>1. The company will use an ICO to get initial funding.</div><div>2. The company will work with respected journalists and news</div><div>organizations to build each system.</div><div>3. Revenue will be generated when reader opt-in to pay. Each</div><div>role will be able to set their own cost when their content</div><div>is viewed. Readers will be able to set a max price for each</div><div>piece of content.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># The how</div><div></div><div>### User Types</div><div></div><div>1. creator - any content creator, cameraman, reporter or journalist</div><div>2. validator - typically a news organization or other editors</div><div>to validate a journalist. These role will be limited.</div><div>3. auditor - researchers to verify accuracy. Anyone can be an</div><div>auditor but trusted auditors will be limited. Only trusted</div><div>auditors will viewable by readers.</div><div>4. reader - any consumers of content. These will be anonymous</div><div>until the blockchain and apps have a wider reach.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div>## Creation Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: The intent is to have reporters report the facts</div><div>as they know them and to have large organizations validate their</div><div>truthfulness.</div><div></div><div>1. Cameraman records live video or journalist completes a story.</div><div>2. Raw content is upload to news site.</div><div>3. Content is posted publicly.</div><div>4. Raw content is hashed. For a news article it must be only the raw text</div><div>of the story. This is to stop tampering.</div><div>5. {hash, timestamp, permanent-url, author-id, person-in-the-content, requested-validator} is added to the blockchain.</div><div>Author's reputation is used to assist in authenticity.</div><div>6. Only newly created news can be added to the blockchain. It will</div><div>force news only to be recorded as it goes public. No retro active updates.</div><div>7. The author will request a news organization to be the validator.</div><div>Each news organization will be responsible for their own internal</div><div>process to validate each report is factual. A recommended place to start</div><div>is to have a handful of devices behind psychical barriers and for</div><div>it to be offline when not in use as well as no access to anything other</div><div>than the blockchain. Only a few agents inside the news organization</div><div>can approve based on personal relationships. Anyone else who</div><div>validates a story will add their validation to the raw content as well.</div><div>8. News organizations will create their own certs/identities</div><div>that will all be chained together. They will manage issuing them</div><div>to devices and how access is administered.</div><div>9. When corrections are needed the creators/validators will</div><div>create a diff (just like with git) with the changes and upload</div><div>the content to the blockchain like before but with a link</div><div>to the original story.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># Auditing Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: Content is useless without accuracy. Independent</div><div>researches must confirm the truth, corroborate information,</div><div>identity opinion and retroactively assess judgement.</div><div></div><div>1. Anyone can audit content. But only trusted auditors will</div><div>be shown to the readers.</div><div>2. Anyone can be an auditor. They can issue corrections, rate the</div><div>accuracy, add annotations, references and add hindsight about</div><div>how practical a position actually worked out in real life. This</div><div>allows readers to not only see truthfulness but also those</div><div>who consistently put things like policy ideals over practicality,</div><div>reason and realistic expectations will receive hits to their</div><div>reputation. This should allow readers to see politicians or reporters</div><div>who consistently lie, misrepresent or interject non-fact-based opinions</div><div>in their content.</div><div>3. Only once a trusted auditor has approved or added their own</div><div>addendums to the content will be it publicly shown to readers.</div><div>4. Since the reader will be prolific and log which anonymous</div><div>reader views content they will be able to be notified when</div><div>content is corrected or when trusted auditors verify content.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div></div><div># Reputation Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: Content creators, validators, auditors and persons of</div><div>interest in the content __must__ all have skin in the game.</div><div>News and truth only works when we can validate</div><div>the single people who saw something themselves. This trust</div><div>must be unable to be doctored.</div><div></div><div>1. The reputation of trusted auditors can be disputed by</div><div>validators and content creators. Other trusted auditors</div><div>can down rank and rebuke other trusted auditors. Validators</div><div>can be auditors as well.</div><div>2. Persons of interest in a piece of content will be scored</div><div>by the trusted auditors. Their collective reputation will be</div><div>displayed in all the reader's software.</div><div>3.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># Stolen Account Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: Content creators, validators and auditors will be</div><div>hacked.</div><div></div><div>1. Each role will create their own id on the blockchain. It</div><div>will be tied to their device or could be hosted in cloud servers.</div><div>2. When an entity creates this id they will need to mark who</div><div>is their recovery contacts.</div><div>3. When a device is stolen or hacked they owner will reach</div><div>out to the recovery contacts to validate a new id. Recovery</div><div>contacts can not be changed ever.</div><div>4. New ids validated by 2/3 of the recovery contacts will</div><div>give provisional status. The more recovery contacts added</div><div>at creation the safer an account will be.</div><div>5. User's can retroactively append a rejection of their approval</div><div>of content as long as 2/3 of the recovery accounts approve. This</div><div>should allow for the informal trust networks to recorrect when</div><div>theft happens while stopping DDOS style of attacks.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># Reader's Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: Readers need to know what is true and see how factual</div><div>sources (persons of interest and news organizations) are. Scripts</div><div>will be available free to all companies to embed in their products.</div><div>Facebook, Twitter and other sites/apps will be able to inform</div><div>readers as they on read and notify them after the fact if</div><div>large parts of a story they viewed change.</div><div></div><div>1. Readers are anonymous. Each device will receive a unique</div><div>id to record viewed content on the blockchain.</div><div>2. A reader can log into multiple devices with all their personal</div><div>data local. This includes which id's they have for other devices.</div><div>3. In order to pay content owners while reducing the ability to</div><div>identify users they will have payouts in random intervals from a</div><div>day to a month. They will find all the content to be paid along</div><div>with their capped limits and transfer it to the content creators,</div><div>validators and auditors.</div><div>4. Each company/site that uses the reader scripts will be required</div><div>to not modify the markup on the content. They will have a consortium</div><div>to reach consensus on changes to the display of the markup. User</div><div>researchers and experts will also be in the consortium to ensure</div><div>that the representation of the content is factual and understandable</div><div>to the readers.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># Payment Process</div><div></div><div>Purpose: Have readers pay for content creators, validators and</div><div>auditors.</div><div></div><div>1. As the system scales readers can start to add a</div><div>wallet to their identity.</div><div>2. When they read an article the content creator, validator</div><div>and trusted auditors will receive payment for the content.</div><div>3. Price setting will be set by owner of the data</div><div>but readers can choose to have a cap per content piece. This</div><div>ensures that creators, validators and trusted auditors don't set</div><div>unreasonable rates.</div><div>4. Payment will work via any app/site accessed</div><div>on a reader's logged in device.</div><div></div><div>---</div><div></div><div># Platform applications</div><div></div><div>1. Blockchain. Most likely to run on Ethereum do to widespread</div><div>adoption and the ability to run smart contracts.</div><div>2. Content creator. Will be code that runs on any device</div><div>to take a url and an author's id to validate on the blockchain.</div><div>This can be via a web page or embedded in any mobile/desktop app.</div><div>3. Validator. Add a validation to content. Can also approve</div><div>new validators (with a long time delay) and remove validators</div><div>from the group in case of theft. There must be a 2/3 majority</div><div>to remove a validator. Validator's reputation will be scored</div><div>by trusted auditors. A select group of large news organizations</div><div>will be the initial validators and can add more validators to the</div><div>blockchain. Additions should be infrequent and requires 50% of</div><div>validators to approve entrance.</div><div>4. Auditing. A few trusted organizations will start as the</div><div>trusted group. Each auditor will have a limited number of</div><div>new auditors they can add. Non-trusted auditor must have a high</div><div>reputation from trusted auditors as well as a history of</div><div>a large amount of work before they can be approved. Upgrading</div><div>to a trusted auditor role must have 50% consensus. The tool will</div><div>allow normal auditors to correct, rebuke and relate sources. Trusted</div><div>auditor content will be viewable by readers.</div><div>5. Readers. This will be a javascript plugin as well as a</div><div>script that can be run in multiple apps. The news organization's</div><div>reputation for accuracy, opinion vs news, content create and</div><div>importance will be displayed. Individual statements in each story</div><div>will overlaid with the truthfulness and other trusted auditor's</div><div>content. This will overlay on both text and video content. Since</div><div>each device has a unique id if a future correct is made by</div><div>the content owner this can send a notification or be displayed</div><div>the next time the reader see __any__ content.</div>
